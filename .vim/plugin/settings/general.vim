" would remove the leading ‘"’ characters.
"
" This 'formatoptions' flag wasn’t added until v7.3.541.  Because we can’t
" test for the availability of option flags directly, we resort to a version

" opposing it for years, I have converted to two-spacing.  You can blame Steve
" Losh
"
" <http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/why-i-two-space/>
"
" Consequently, we specify that sentence objects for the purposes of the ‘s’
" text object, the ‘(’ and ‘)’ sentence motions, and formatting with the 'gq'
" command must be separated by *two* spaces.  One space does not suffice.
"
" My defection to the two-spacers is also the reason I now leave 'joinspaces'
" set, per its default, so that two spaces are inserted when consecutive
" sentences separated by a line break are joined onto one line by the ‘J’
" command.

set cpoptions+=J

" Separating sentences with two spaces has an advantage in making a clear
" distinction between two different types of periods: periods that abbreviate
" longer words, as in “Mr. Moolenaar”, and periods that terminate sentences,
" like this one.
"
" If we’re using two-period spacing for sentences, Vim can interpret the
" different spacing to distinguish between the two types, and can thereby
" avoid breaking a line just after an abbreviating period.  For example, the
" two words in “Mr. Moolenaar” should never be split apart, lest the
" abbreviation “Mr.” look too much like the end of a sentence.  This also
" preserves the semantics of that same period for subsequent reformatting; its
" single-space won’t get lost.
"
" So, getting back to our 'formatoptions' settings, that is what the ‘p’ flag
" does.  I wrote the patch that added it, after becoming envious of an
" analogous feature during an ill-fated foray into GNU Emacs usage.

" Press your 'leader' key + enter to clear search highlighting:
" nnoremap <silent> <leader><CR> :noh<CR>

" I end up hitting CTRL-L to clear or redraw the screen in interactive shells
" and tools like Mutt and Vim pretty often.  It feels natural to me to stack
" issuing a :nohlsearch command to stop highlighting searches on top of this.
"
" This gets by far the most use in normal mode, but I’d like it to work in
" insert and visual modes, too, where it’s occasionally useful, especially on
" things like mobile phone terminal emulators that can be choppy and require
" a lot of redrawing.
"
" For each of these, we end the mapping with a CTRL-L in normal mode, thereby
" extending rather than replacing Vim’s normal behavior.
"
nnoremap <C-L>
      \ :<C-U>nohlsearch<CR><C-L>

" The insert mode wrapper for normal CTRL-L uses i_CTRL-O to issue a single
" normal mode command.  We intentionally use ‘:normal’ rather than ‘:normal!’
" so that the mapping works recursively.  I tried using <C-O><C-L> with :imap
" for this, but it didn’t work.  Maybe i_CTRL-O doesn’t respect mappings.
" I couldn’t find any documentation about it.
"

      \ <C-O>:execute "normal \<C-L>"<CR>

" We use :vmap here rather than :xmap to have the mapping applied for select
" mode as well as visual mode.  This is because CTRL-L doesn’t reflect
" a printable character, and so we don't shadow anything by making it work,
" even though I don’t actually use select mode directly very much.
